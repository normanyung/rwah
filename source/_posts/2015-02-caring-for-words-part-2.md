How shall I reflect on the class I just finished? 

I started out thinking I was taking a class with a grumpy grammar grunt. In a way I think the same at the end of the course, and I still hold the opinion that "caring for words" is *not* a moral issue, but I think I finished this course realizing that I *do* enjoy writing, even though it comes to be very slowly. I'm afraid that I am also a stickler for grammar and good writing. I've become more perceptive; I noticing the poor use of language around me more and my circumstances have not changed.

I thought my last post deserved a follow up and I'm hoping this outlet will encourage me to write more often.

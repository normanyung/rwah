_To you, O LORD, I call;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my rock, be not deaf to me,
lest, if you be silent to me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I become like those who go down to the pit._

I meditated on this psalm for the first time last week and it’s been on my mind ever since. honestly i can’t recall this psalm; i usually just straight from 23 to maybe 27 and then 29… what did i miss in between?

here david calls out in the midst of people who do not recognize the LORD and laments that if God were deaf to his cries, he would be no different than those who hate God. is that one of the marks of God’s people? that he hears us? surely david’s not writing about mere knowledge but of an attentive care to his own children.

any parent can hear other children being nuts on the playground but they know specifically the cries of their own… there’s a certain tamber in the sound, they way the voice dips at the end. parents can hear their own children through any chaos; how much more the God who is attentive to our cries for help and deliverance?

_Blessed be the LORD!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For he has heard the voice of my pleas for mercy.
The LORD is my strength and my shield;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in him my heart trusts, and I am helped;
my heart exults,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and with my song I give thanks to him._

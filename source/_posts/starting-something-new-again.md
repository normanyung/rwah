### Trying this again
I've started more blogs than I can remember. My longest running one probably was my Xanga. Next was maybe the first time I ran a site here on this domain, robotwithaheart.com. My girlfriend (now wife) helped me design that and she drew and scanned all these robots for me to use all over the site. Good times. Maybe waybackmachine has a copy of it somewhere. I definitely don't.

I'm now married. A father of two daughters. And I figure I should probably get writing before time passes me by and I forget. Even now, just looking back one year, my older daughter, Rehema, has changed so much. Steph keeps reminding me that one day they will move out of the house; she says she's reminding me so she can help me prepare. They will never move out; I just can't accept that! 

### Some goals
But before I get carried away in this first post, maybe I should make public some goals with today being the new year and all. With this blog, I want to write at once a month. That should be a pretty attainable goal, right? Once a week would probably be better but I don't want to set myself up to fail.

So what do I think I'll write about? Just whatever is going on, whether that be a new small project I'm working on or Rehema and Selah's next big milestone. Hopefully I'll one day be able to look through these posts and laugh a little and perhaps jog my memory of where I've been and what I've done. 

This blog is my first Jekyll based blog that I'm making public; all my previous ones were Wordpress but that has gotten tiring. Looking forward to this blog being stored as flat files in git and entries in markdown rather than editing in a wysiwyg editor!

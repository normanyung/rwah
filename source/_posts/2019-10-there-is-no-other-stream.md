There’s this scene I love at the beginning of _The Silver Chair_ from CS Lewis’s Chronicles of Narnia… where Jill Pole, a young girl, finds herself in a forest—alone and parched— dreadfully thirsty… 

And at her realization of her thirst, the forest goes silent…  the birds stop singing — a perfect silence except for one persistent sound of running water coming from a distance… so her thirst drives her to to the stream… she gets to it… she sees it… and here i quote from the book:

> But although the sight of water made her feel ten times thirstier than before, she didn’t rush forward and drink. She stood as still as if she had been turned into stone, with her mouth wide open. And she had a very good reason: just on this side of the stream lay the lion.
>
> …“If I run away, it’ll be after me in a moment,” thought Jill. “And if I go on, I shall run straight into its mouth.” Anyway, she couldn’t have moved if she had tried, and she couldn’t take her eyes off it. How long this lasted, she could not be sure; it seemed like hours. And the thirst became so bad that she almost felt she would not mind being eaten by the lion if only she could be sure of getting a mouthful of water first.
>
> “If you’re thirsty, you may drink.”
>
> …For a second she stared here and there, wondering who had spoken. Then the voice said again, “If you are thirsty, come and drink.”…It was deeper, wilder, and stronger; a sort of heavy, golden voice. It did not make her any less frightened than she had been before, but it made her frightened in rather a different way.
> 
> “Are you not thirsty?” said the Lion.
> 
> “I’m dying of thirst,” said Jill.
> 
> “Then drink,” said the Lion.
> 
> “May I — could I — would you mind going away while I do?” said Jill.
The Lion answered this only by a look and a very low growl. And as Jill gazed at its motionless bulk, she realised that she might as well have asked a whole mountain to move aside for her convenience.
> 
> The delicious rippling noise of the stream was driving her nearly frantic.
> 
> “Will you promise not to – do anything to me, if I do come?” said Jill.
> 
> “I make no promise,” said the Lion.
> 
> …“I daren’t come and drink,” said Jill.
> 
> “Then you will die of thirst,” said the Lion.
> 
> “Oh dear!” said Jill, coming another step nearer. “I suppose I must go and look for another stream then.”
> 
> “There is no other stream,” said the Lion.
> 
> It never occurred to Jill to disbelieve the Lion – no one who had seen his stern face could do that – and her mind suddenly made itself up. It was the worst thing she had ever had to do, but she went forward to the stream, knelt down, and began scooping up water in her hand. It was the coldest, most refreshing water she had ever tasted. You didn’t need to drink much of it, for it quenched your thirst at once.

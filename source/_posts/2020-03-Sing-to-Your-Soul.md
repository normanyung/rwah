These days we find ourselves locked at home, physically disconnected from friends, family, and community. It's been difficult. Challenging. Our work is strained. Our relationships are tested. We're managing — or at least trying to. We're making the best of our circumstances.

But Sunday Worship is the time for the church — even if we're scattered on ZOOM — to reset. We gather to realign ourselves to the truth of the Gospel when all week long we may have aligned ourselves with other goals: scarcity, loneliness, helplessness. But one thing we lose in this day of online virtual worship services is the real feel of the community encouraging one another in the Gospel. This is especially apparent when we gather to — online — to sing.

How easy it is to watch the singing on the screen rather than participate.

It might feel awkward to sing in our apartments, especially if we're just one of a handful of voices — every out-of-tune note or early-entrance-become-solo clearly heard by all. Maybe we think it's easier just to listen to those in the call singing. But don't give into that. Sing!

Surely, I can remind you, "God cares about it." Or I can tell those of you who are parents, "Your children are watching and learning about worship from your example." These are both true. But I'd put forward to you that…

Your soul is listening.

There's a well known refrain in the psalms (scattered throughout Psalms 42 and 43) that goes like this:

> Why are you cast down, O my soul,  
> and why are you in turmoil within me?  
> Hope in God; for I shall again praise him,  
> my salvation and my God.

Here the psalmist is ministering to his soul. This *part* of us is really *all* of us. It is in our soul — our very being — that we are united with Christ. But our souls are "prone to wander" as the hymns put it. And now, when all is stripped away from daily routine, our souls are raw. Every grim announcement and every sliver of hope tugs our souls this way and that; they toss us to and fro in the stormy waves of our present situation.

So as we gather tomorrow to worship; resist the temptation to sit idly and watch. Sing! Remind your soul where our hope lies. Remind your soul that even if all gives way, there is a sure Anchor that keeps us steady in the waves. It's the Anchor that we can never lose because He holds onto us.

Sing! So your soul will not despair.

Sing! They your soul may know the Hope that keeps us even now.

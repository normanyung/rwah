Pastor Rob gave us a very good word to consider this past Sunday from Psalm 146 in anticipation of this week and all the anxiety many of us may be experiencing regarding the election. Yes, as citizens and members of society, we are called to "submit our ballots," yet, as believers, we are not called to "submit our hopes." Still I find it difficult to completely detach myself from this contentious election race. I've focused my attention to some books. I've played several games of AmongUs. I've joined some fellow anxious saints in prayer. I've been running around trying to distract myself with *anything* to not see the live updates. And I was convicted in my busyness to *slow down*.

Psalm 46 ends with the familiar line, "Be still and know that I am God." If you're feeling anything like me today, I encourage you to stop where you are and take a solid few minutes to read and let this psalm get into the core of your being today.

> Psalm 46
> 
> To the choirmaster. Of the Sons of Korah. According to Alamoth. A Song.
> 
>     God is our refuge and strength,
>         a very present help in trouble.
>     Therefore we will not fear though the earth gives way,
>         though the mountains be moved into the heart of the sea,
>     though its waters roar and foam,
>         though the mountains tremble at its swelling. *Selah*
>     
>     There is a river whose streams make glad the city of God,
>         the holy habitation of the Most High.
>     God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved;
>         God will help her when morning dawns.
>     The nations rage, the kingdoms totter;
>         he utters his voice, the earth melts.
>     The LORD of hosts is with us;
>         the God of Jacob is our fortress. *Selah*
>     
>     Come, behold the works of the LORD,
>         how he has brought desolations on the earth.
>     He makes wars cease to the end of the earth;
>         he breaks the bow and shatters the spear;
>         he burns the chariots with fire.
>     "Be still, and know that I am God.
>         I will be exalted among the nations,
>         I will be exalted in the earth!"
>     The LORD of hosts is with us;
>         the God of Jacob is our fortress. *Selah*

This psalm describes the raging nations of today so well. We make all this noise, and somehow distract ourselves into thinking and believing that this — *this* — moment is the ultimate moment. But this psalm lays down the truth that it's not; the LORD merely utters his voice and everything melts.

The lead up to the familiar "Be still…" line shows a God who brings desolations on the earth. He allows our nonsense to ensue until all is dust. Perhaps only when we let the chaos and restlessness in our hearts stop, can we finally recognize who is God. God is found in the stillness. And we need to fight the noise of today to seek that stillness. Slow down. Slow down so you can keep pace with God. Slow down so you can hear his voice. Slow down so we can discern his leading in this tumultuous time.
